# Adventure-By-Warren-Robinnet-Hacked-To-Include-Music

# This project is strictly educational. No monetary gain is accepted. All rights to the game, Adventure, belong to Warren Robinnet.
# The attached code was originally written by Warren Robinett but was modified by myself, ZippyGorilla, so that the game would have constant music.
# In order to play the game, one can use an emulator for binary files, such as Stella: https://stella-emu.github.io/docs/index.html#Installation, and run the .bin file with it.
# Also attached, for convenience of reading the code, is the .asm file.
